# UI for Agentic AI

Leveraged the SwiftUI frontend framework to transform an LLM's output into a native and interactive UI.
Intended as a no code frontend for ai agents that require complex user choices into an elegant UI.
Fine tuned an OpenAI LLM to optimize for output quality via handmade examples of input output pairs.
